Weather Wallpaper
=================

Tiny python script to update wallpaper with satellite weather map from a
server (IMD and JMA currently). Works for Gnome 2 and 3.  Indian
Meteorological Department (IMD) is the relevant server for me. It can be
extended for other servers as well.

# one may want add crontab as following to update the wallpaper for every hour
# at 6th minute
